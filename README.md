This repository contains the code for our paper **"Multimodal Clustering of Boolean Tensors on MapReduce: Experiments Revisited"**, which continues our previos work on disributed triclustering of 3-ary Boolean tensors (or triadic formal contexts).

**Abstract**

*The paper presents further development of distributed multimodal clustering. We introduce a new version of multimodal
clustering algorithm for distributed processing in Apache Hadoop on computer clusters. Its implementation allows a user
to conduct clustering on data with modality more or equal two. We provide time and space complexity of the algorithm
and justify its relevance. The algorithm is adapted for MapReduce distributed processing model. The program is
implemented by means of Apache Hadoop framework is able to perform parallel computing on thousands of nodes.*
