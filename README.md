This repository contains the code for our paper **"Multimodal Clustering of Boolean Tensors on MapReduce: Experiments Revisited"**, which continues our previos work on disributed triclustering of 3-ary Boolean tensors (or triadic formal contexts).

**Abstract**

*This paper presents further development of distributed mul- timodal clustering. We introduce a new version of multimodal clustering algorithm for distributed processing in Apache Hadoop on computer clus- ters. Its implementation allows a user to conduct clustering on data with modality greater than two. We provide time and space complexity of the algorithm and justify its relevance. The algorithm is adapted for MapRe- duce distributed processing model. The program implemented by means of Apache Hadoop framework is able to perform parallel computing on thousands of nodes.*
